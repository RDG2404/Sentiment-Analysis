# Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to identify the correlation between changing oil prices and consumer sentiment states as portrayed through tweets from financial news outlets over a period of 14 days in March 2022. Oil prices were fluctuating rapidly during this period of time due to post-COVID recovery as well as political instability in eastern Europe. 

Crude Oil equities are regulated carefully through international laws, as well as oil companies themselves based on a variety of factors including supply and demand.  
We believed it would be interesting to identify whether there was any correlation between how the general public felt about oil prices and the change in oil equities themselves. For example, we wanted to see whether a rise in gas prices would prompt general consumers to opt for public transport en-masse and thereby reduce demand for oil, leading to a price decrease. 

This project aims to give a quantifiable estimation of exactly how much public sentiment influences oil prices using sentiment analysis on just the 3-hidden states (good, neutral, or bad public opinion) using a Hidden Markov Model, thereby allowing for more accurate price prediction in the future!
